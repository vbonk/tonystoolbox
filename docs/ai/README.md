# AI System Design Documentation (`/docs/ai/`)

This folder contains newly introduced architectural, UI/UX, and operational documents designed to **extend Tonyâ€™s Toolbox** with advanced AI SaaS system patterns.

These documents DO NOT replace existing documentation, but rather:

- Provide deeper guidance for designing outcome-driven AI workflows
- Cover UI/UX best practices aligned with SaaS 3.0 paradigms
- Introduce modular, maintainable automation strategies
- Define context and continuous learning systems

---

## Integration Instructions

To incorporate these:

1. Link to each document in your main `/docs/README.md` or equivalent TOC
2. Use `docs/ai/README.md` as the landing page for this folder
3. Keep these files versioned under `/docs/ai/` without overwriting your main PRD or architecture files
